# debrISR
An attempt at using experimental incoherent scatter radar `ISR` measurements to detect space debris.

>NOTE: Any user attempting to use this codebase should know the physics of ISR debris detection still require maturation and should **NOT** be using any part of this codebase in any production environment

## Installation
TBA - (i.e when there is something of substance :grin:)
